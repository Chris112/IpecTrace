IpecTrace allows Toll IPEC employers to quickly lookup a consignment number and generate barcodes for items contained within the consignment for efficient and fast scanning within the warehouse or on the road.

Features:
- Lookup by photo: Take a photo of a valid Toll IPEC SSCC barcode and IpecTrace will identify the number from the barcode.
- Lookup by manual entry: Enter a valid reference/consignment/item number and IpecTrace will return all items related to the number.
- Generate Barcode: Enter any input and generate a barcode to scan straight off the screen.
